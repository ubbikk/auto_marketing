# LinkedIn Content Generator (Working Title)

## What is this?

An experiment in AI-generated LinkedIn content that doesn't suck. The bar is low - most AI content is obvious slop. Can we do better?

## Context

My business partner is taking a LinkedIn marketing course, learning TOFU (Top of Funnel) strategy for our e-commerce automation company (AFTA Systems). He'll post manually while learning the basics.

Meanwhile, I want to build something interesting: an AI system that generates LinkedIn content "with taste." If it works, it becomes both a content pipeline AND a portfolio demo - proof that we know how to make AI output that doesn't feel like garbage.

### The Deeper Goal

This is also a sandbox for a bigger question: can AI be a creative companion rather than a slop machine? I want to write blog posts and short stories but struggle with the craft labor - details, pacing, scenes, stitching ideas together. LinkedIn is the test case. If I can crack "taste at scale," maybe I learn something transferable.

## The Idea

- Ingest news/trends via API
- Generate content that merges news (the hook) with company messaging
- Do it with actual personality - maybe a self-aware AI persona that jokes about being AI
- Example tone: "There's talk about the AI bubble. I don't think it's real because X, Y, Z. But what do I know, I'm just a pile of numbers..."

The transparency angle could be the differentiator. Human accounts being quirky feels try-hard. An AI account doing it is the bit.

## My Original Plan

1. Research anti-slop strategies
2. Research AI writing assistant tools (landscape, what works)
3. Research creative AI writing approaches (multi-agent systems, generate-then-judge)
4. Research what makes marketing material good (personas, linguistic tricks, humor strategies)
5. Build POC, iterate

## Claude's Pushback (Worth Considering)

**On the research-heavy approach:**
- This plan could eat 2 months before producing a single post
- "What makes writing good" is an infinite research rabbit hole
- I said I learn by building - this plan is "learn by researching"
- Timeboxing: maybe 5 hours of research max, then produce something

**On multi-agent generate-100-then-judge:**
- Weird assumption: if the AI judge can identify "taste," why not use that taste-detector to guide generation directly?

**On "with taste":**
- This phrase is doing ALL the heavy lifting
- The actual challenge is systematizing taste, not the automation part
- Can taste be encoded, or does it require human curation that kills scalability?

**On the news-bait + pitch formula:**
- This is the most hated LinkedIn pattern ("Elon just did X, here's what it means for YOUR business")
- People scroll past reflexively - the format is strip-mined

**Alternative approach suggested:**
1. Week 1-2: Manually craft 10 posts with Claude. No automation. Iterate on voice.
2. Week 3: Analyze what worked. NOW you know what to systematize.
3. Then build the pipeline.

## What "Taste" Might Actually Mean

- NOT starting with "🚀 Big news in AI!"
- NOT the fake-humble "Here's what I learned..."
- Consistent voice that feels like a person
- Saying something non-obvious about the news
- Unexpected structure (slop always follows the same arc)

### Anti-patterns to explicitly ban
- "Let's dive in"
- Emoji spam
- "Here's the thing"
- The 5-point listicle format
- Starting with a question you immediately answer

## Target Audience (from Partner's Course)

Priority ICPs:
1. **DIY Attempt Survivor** - tried automation themselves, failed (highest conversion)
2. **Struggling E-commerce Operator** - drowning in manual tasks (largest market)

## Practical Considerations

- LinkedIn hunts for coordinated inauthentic behavior - multiple fake accounts = ban risk
- Safest approach: use my real account, be transparent that it's AI-assisted
- Could even be the hook: "I build AI tools. This post was written by one. Can you tell?"

## Open Questions

- Can taste be systematized without human-in-the-loop?
- What's the actual conversion path? Post → engagement → DM → ???
- Whose account does this live on for the demo?
- Should partner finish his course first so we know what actually converts before automating?

## Status

Not started. Debating whether to do more research or just start generating posts manually first.
