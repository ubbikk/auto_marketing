## Key Algorithm Insights (360Brew)

1. **Quality > Quantity** - consistency matters, but only post if quality is maintained
2. **Hashtags no longer matter** - algorithm analyzes content themes instead
3. **First 2 hours are critical** - respond to all comments quickly
4. **Engage before posting** - comment on 5-10 posts before publishing your own

---

## Content Quality Standards

### Source Verification
- Use only reputable sources (industry publications, research firms, verified companies)
- Reject content farms and unverified blogs
- Check company LinkedIn presence before citing them
- Follow credible companies to build network

### LinkedIn Formatting Rules
- No markdown bold (`**text**`) - LinkedIn doesn't support it
- Use plain URLs only (no `[text](url)` format)
- Tag companies with `@CompanyName` (max 2-3 per post)
- Use ALL CAPS sparingly for emphasis

## 5 Core Messaging Pillars

Use these across all content:

1. **Speed**: "Quick wins in 2-4 weeks" (not months)
2. **Expertise**: "Business process discovery first" (differentiator)
3. **Accessibility**: "No technical knowledge needed" (removes barrier)
4. **Results**: "Save time, increase efficiency" (quantified benefits)
5. **Urgency**: "Don't get left behind" (competitive pressure)
