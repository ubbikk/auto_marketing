Overview
AI automation for e-commerce • n8n specialist

AFTA helps small and medium e-commerce businesses automate repetitive workflows so you can focus on growth. We combine business process discovery with production-ready n8n automation to save you hours every day, reduce errors, and increase sales.

What We Automate:

Order Processing & Inventory Management – Process orders automatically, sync inventory across channels, get alerts when stock is low. Save hours every day and reduce errors.

Customer Messages & Support – Auto-respond to inquiries, send order updates automatically, handle common support questions. Respond faster and improve satisfaction.

Marketing Campaigns & Segmentation – Send targeted campaigns automatically, segment customers by behavior, trigger personalized messages. Increase sales without extra work.

Business Analysis & Automation Strategy – We analyze your business and find automation opportunities. You get a clear plan with expected savings: identify time-wasting tasks, calculate potential savings, build a roadmap.

Why Choose AFTA?

Most e-commerce businesses know their operations are inefficient, but lack a structured approach to identify automation opportunities and validate ROI. You may have tried DIY tools like Zapier, Make.com, or n8n, but failed due to poor scoping—not technical limitations.

Our advantage: combining business analytical expertise with deep n8n automation capabilities.

What Makes Us Different:

• Business Process Discovery First – We understand your business deeply before we automate  
• Service vs. Product – Custom automation services (less commitment) rather than full platform migration  
• n8n Specialists – Production-ready automations using proven frameworks  
• Professional Service Delivery – Legal entity accountability with ongoing support
