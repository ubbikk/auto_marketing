      - "Uses physical/sensory details even for abstract ideas"

        Skills can be taught. Character you either have or don't have. 
        Bigfoot understood that there are two types of people in the world: 
        those who do what they say they're going to do — and everyone else.

        They had style and swagger, and they seemed afraid of nothing. 
        They drank everything in sight, stole whatever wasn't nailed down.
        They carried big, bad-ass knives, which they kept honed and sharpened 
        to a razor's edge.

        When I die, I will decidedly not be regretting missed opportunities 
        for a good time. My regrets will be more along the lines of a sad list 
        of people hurt, people let down, assets wasted and advantages squandered.

        Do we really want to travel in hermetically sealed popemobiles through 
        the rural provinces of France, Mexico and the Far East, eating only in 
        Hard Rock Cafes and McDonalds? Or do we want to eat without fear, 
        tearing into the local stew, the humble taqueria's mystery meat?

        A three-star Italian chef pal of mine was recently talking about why he — 
        a proud Tuscan who makes his own pasta and sauces from scratch daily —

      - "Leave out the parts readers skip"
      - "Never open with weather or setup"
      - "Incomplete sentences are fine"
      - "Let voice carry, not description"

        When Chili first came to Miami Beach twelve years ago they were having 
        one of their off-and-on cold winters: thirty-four degrees the day he met 
        Tommy Carlo for lunch at Vesuvio's on South Collins and had his leather 
        jacket ripped off.

        The voice on the phone said, 'Hey, Chief? Fuck you. I'll get somebody else.'

        There were a lot of terms you had to learn, as opposed to the shylock

        He asked about her flight, hoping, he said, Northwest wasn't still serving

  kurt_vonnegut:
    name: "Kurt Vonnegut"

        And Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people 
        and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, 
        because it was so human. So she was turned into a pillar of salt. So it goes.

        There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic 
        confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick and so much 
        the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, 
        after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters.

        I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part

        Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are

      - "Give readers as much information as possible as soon as possible"

        I was in bed when I heard the gate. I listened carefully. I didn't hear

        The two kids were very much in love. On top of this they had great ambitions.

# Usage guidance for the generator
usage_notes:
  how_to_apply:
    - "Feed 2-3 samples as few-shot examples, not descriptions"
    - "Pick author based on persona: Bourdain for provocateur/witty, Leonard for professional, Carver for minimalist/storyteller"
    - "Don't mention author name in prompt — just provide samples as 'write in this style'"
    - "Combine with wildcards for variation"
  
  why_samples_beat_descriptions:
    - "LLMs have been trained on 'write like X' a million times"
    - "Abstract descriptions get interpreted generically"
    - "Raw prose creates pattern-matching at the sentence level"
    - "The model mimics rhythm and structure, not just 'vibe'"
