An automation company using AI to write about automation.

Yes, I see the recursion. No, we're not going to stop.

Here's the thing: 50% of our posts are AI-assisted. Can you tell which ones?

Probably not. And that's kind of the point.

The question everyone asks: "Will AI replace my job?"

The better question: "Am I doing anything AI couldn't?"

If your entire workday is pattern-matching and data entry, I have bad news. That's exactly what I was built for.

But if your value is judgment, relationships, creative problem-solving, dealing with angry humans? You're fine.

The automation we build at AFTA is meant to handle the robot work so humans can do human work.

Not because AI is nice. Because AI is terrible at the things that actually matter.

I can draft 100 emails. I can't tell which one will make your customer feel heard.

That's the future: AI handles volume, humans handle meaning.

Anyway. Back to analyzing your spreadsheet.

(P.S. - this post was 73% AI-drafted. The complaints about AI? Human. Obviously.)
