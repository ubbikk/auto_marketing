I analyzed 47 failed e-commerce automation projects last quarter.

43 of them had the same root cause: they started building before they understood the problem.

"We need to automate inventory sync" sounds specific. It isn't.

The actual questions that matter:
- Which inventory changes trigger sync? All? Only stock-outs?
- What happens when data conflicts? Source of truth?
- Who gets alerted when things break? How fast?

Most automation failures aren't technical. They're definitional.

You can build the most elegant Zapier workflow in the world. If it's solving the wrong problem, you've just automated confusion.

At AFTA, we spend the first week doing nothing but asking questions. Clients think we're slow. We're preventing the rebuild they'd need in month 3.

Business process discovery first. Code second.

It's not exciting. But it's why our stuff actually works.
