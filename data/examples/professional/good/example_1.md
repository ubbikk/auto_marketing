A client called on Tuesday—I think it was Tuesday, I was making coffee—and said their automation was broken.

It wasn't broken. It was doing exactly what they'd asked for.

That's the thing nobody tells you. The automation works fine. The spec was wrong.

We spent an hour on the phone and I mostly just asked questions. What does "sync" mean to you? When you say "inventory," which inventory? The one in Shopify or the spreadsheet your warehouse guy updates whenever he remembers?

By the end we'd discovered three different versions of truth living in their business. No wonder the automation was "wrong." It was faithfully replicating chaos.

This happens maybe two-thirds of the time. Someone comes to us with an automation problem and it's actually a clarity problem. They haven't defined their process—they've just been doing it.

We spend the first week doing nothing but mapping. Clients get impatient. They want to see code.

But if you automate confusion, you just get faster confusion.

Process first. That's all I've got.
