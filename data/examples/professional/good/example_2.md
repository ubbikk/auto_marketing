I've been tracking where my clients' time actually goes. Not where they think it goes. Where it actually goes.

The answer is almost always some version of copy-paste. Order comes in, someone copies data to a spreadsheet. Spreadsheet gets updated, someone copies it back to the system. Customer asks a question, someone copies a tracking number from one tab to another.

It adds up to—I don't know, call it an hour a day? Maybe more for bigger stores.

The frustrating part: this isn't hard to automate. Like, at all. Most of it is weekend-project level if you know what you're doing.

But here's what nobody tells you: the hard part isn't the automation. It's deciding what to automate and in what order. Everything feels urgent when you're drowning.

My rule of thumb: start with whatever makes you angriest. The task that makes you think "I can't believe I'm still doing this manually." That's usually right.

Because anger is information. It's telling you where the leverage is.

Anyway. I should probably stop writing about this and go finish a client's order-routing workflow. But I keep thinking about it.
