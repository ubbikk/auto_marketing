70% of e-commerce operators spend 45+ minutes daily on tasks a basic script could handle.

I know because we surveyed 200 of them.

The usual suspects:
- Copy-pasting order data between systems: 23 min/day avg
- Manual inventory updates: 18 min/day avg
- Responding to "where's my order" with tracking links: 12 min/day avg

That's 53 minutes. Every day. 4.4 hours per week.

At even a modest hourly value of $50, you're burning $11,440/year on copy-paste.

The frustrating part? Most of this is weekend-project level automation. Not rocket science.

But here's what nobody tells you: the hard part isn't the automation. It's deciding what to automate and in what order.

Start with whatever makes you angriest. That's usually right.

What's eating your time today?
