Your Zapier setup isn't automation. It's a Rube Goldberg machine with a monthly fee.

I audited 30 e-commerce stores last quarter that called themselves "automated." Here's what I found:

26 of them had at least one person manually copying data between tabs. Every day.

19 had Zapier workflows that broke so often they'd assigned someone to "check the zaps" each morning. That's not automation. That's a babysitting job with extra steps.

12 were paying over $200/month for tools that handled maybe 30% of what they needed.

The problem isn't the tools. Zapier is fine for simple stuff. The problem is nobody sat down and mapped the actual process before building anything.

You wouldn't renovate a house without blueprints. But somehow everyone thinks they can automate a 47-step order fulfillment process by watching a YouTube tutorial.

At AFTA, we spend the first week doing nothing but asking questions and mapping workflows. Clients think we're slow. We're preventing the $15K rebuild they'd need in 6 months.

Automation without process discovery is just faster chaos.
