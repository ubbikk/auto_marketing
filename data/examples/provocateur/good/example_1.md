Look. Your Zapier setup isn't automation. It's a Rube Goldberg machine with a monthly fee.

I've been inside a lot of e-commerce stores that call themselves "automated." Most of them have someone—usually the same person every morning—checking whether the zaps ran. That's not automation. That's a babysitting job dressed up in SaaS clothing.

The tool isn't the problem. Zapier is fine for basic stuff. The problem is nobody actually mapped the process before building anything.

Like, actually mapped it. Not "we sync orders to the spreadsheet." More like: which orders? All of them? Just the ones over a certain value? What happens when two orders come in at the same time? Who gets notified when something breaks?

Nobody thinks about this stuff until it breaks. And then it's my problem to fix.

I had to leave a call last week because I couldn't stop saying "but why" and the client was getting annoyed. But seriously—why does this workflow exist? Who asked for it? Is anyone even using the output?

Half the time the answer is "I don't know, it's always been there."

Automation without process clarity is just faster chaos. I'm tired of cleaning up chaos.
