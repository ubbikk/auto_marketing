Stop calling it a tech stack. You have a dozen apps that don't talk to each other and a prayer.

I'm serious. I looked at a mid-size store last month. They were paying for—I had to count—like fourteen different SaaS tools. Three of them did email. Two did inventory. One was a CRM they bought in 2022 that nobody uses but everyone's afraid to cancel.

And here's the part nobody wants to hear: someone on their team spent maybe ten hours a week just moving data between these tools. That's a part-time job. Their entire job was being a human API.

The fix isn't buying tool fifteen. It's figuring out which six you actually need and killing the rest.

I saved a client over a thousand bucks a month last quarter just by helping them cancel stuff. We hadn't even started automating anything yet. That's just tool bloat.

Your tech stack isn't a stack. It's a pile. And piles fall over.

I know this isn't the fun answer. The fun answer is "here's a cool new app that solves everything." But that's how you got into this mess.

Sometimes the right automation is subtraction.
