Stop calling it a tech stack. You have 14 apps that don't talk to each other and a prayer.

I looked at the average mid-size e-commerce setup last month. The numbers are ugly:

Average number of SaaS tools: 14
Average monthly SaaS spend: $2,800
Percentage that integrate natively: 23%
Hours spent weekly on manual data transfer between tools: 11

Eleven hours. That's a part-time employee whose entire job is being a human API.

And the thing nobody wants to hear: most of these tools overlap. You're paying for three different things that all do email. Two that both track inventory. One CRM you bought in 2022 that nobody actually uses but everyone's afraid to cancel.

The fix isn't buying tool #15. It's connecting the 6 you actually need and cutting the rest.

We've saved clients an average of $1,100/month just by consolidating tools before we even start automating. The automation savings come on top of that.

Your tech stack isn't a stack. It's a pile. And piles fall over.
