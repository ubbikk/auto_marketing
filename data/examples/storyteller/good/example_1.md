At 11 PM on a Tuesday, Sarah was manually updating 340 product prices. Her Shopify store had grown faster than her processes.

She'd been at it since 7. Four hours of copy-paste between a supplier spreadsheet and her admin panel. Row by row. Tab by tab.

At row 212, she fat-fingered a decimal point. A $45 candle became $4.50. She didn't catch it until 37 people had ordered.

That night cost her $1,500 in losses and a weekend of damage control.

The fix wasn't complicated. A single n8n workflow now pulls her supplier's price list, compares it to her current prices, flags anomalies over 10%, and updates the rest automatically. Takes 4 minutes. Runs at 6 AM before she wakes up.

Sarah told me last week she forgot it existed. That's how automation should feel. Not like a project. Like a thing that just... works.

If your Tuesday nights look like Sarah's used to, something is broken. Not you. Your process.
