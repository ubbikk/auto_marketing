The Slack ping came while I was making coffee. It's always while you're making coffee.

Sarah—not her real name—was panicking. She'd somehow broken the price sync we'd built for her last month. Except she hadn't.

What happened was this: her supplier sent the weekly price update early. Usually comes Tuesday. This week it came Monday. The workflow triggered on schedule, pulled the file, ran the comparison, flagged anomalies.

Except there weren't any anomalies. The prices hadn't changed. The file was from last week.

So the system did nothing. Because nothing needed to happen. And Sarah interpreted "system did nothing" as "system is broken."

I spent twenty minutes explaining that the silence was the feature. The workflow checked, found no changes, and moved on. That's what we wanted.

She didn't believe me at first. "But it always sends me an email."

It does. When something changes. Nothing changed.

I think about this a lot. The hardest part of automation isn't making it work. It's making people trust it when it's working correctly.

Silence doesn't feel like success. But sometimes it is.
