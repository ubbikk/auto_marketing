He told me automation doesn't work for his business.

This was—when was this, November? October? Sometime last fall. He ran an outdoor gear store. Not huge, not tiny. Maybe a couple thousand products across three warehouses.

He'd tried Zapier twice before. Both times it broke within a few weeks. Orders slipping through, inventory counts drifting. He gave up and hired another part-timer.

I said okay, show me.

We didn't build anything for the first week. I just... watched. Sat in on calls. Looked at spreadsheets. Asked questions that probably annoyed everyone.

What I found: his team spent most of their time doing three things. Checking inventory across warehouses. Routing orders to the right location. Copying tracking numbers into emails.

Simple stuff. But each one had weird edge cases. An item split across two warehouses. A customer who ordered twice in one day. A supplier who sends CSVs with different column headers every month because apparently that's a thing suppliers do.

His Zapier setup couldn't handle the edge cases. So it broke. So he stopped trusting it.

We built him seven workflows. Took maybe three weeks. His part-timer does customer stuff now instead of data entry.

Last week he texted me a screenshot. "First month I haven't worked a weekend since 2022."

That's not really an automation story. It's a weekend.
