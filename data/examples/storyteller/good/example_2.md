Three months ago, a client told us "automation doesn't work for my business." He ran a mid-size outdoor gear store. 2,000 SKUs. Three warehouse locations.

He'd tried Zapier twice. Both times, the workflows broke within weeks. Orders slipped through. Inventory counts drifted. He went back to spreadsheets and hired another part-timer.

We spent the first week not building anything. We mapped his actual workflow. Not what he thought he did. What he actually did.

Turns out 60% of his team's time went to three things: cross-checking inventory across warehouses, manually routing orders to the nearest fulfillment point, and copy-pasting tracking numbers into customer emails.

None of these were hard to automate. But each one had edge cases his Zapier setup couldn't handle. An item split across two warehouses. A customer who ordered twice in one day. A supplier who sends CSVs with different column headers every month.

We built 7 workflows. Took 3 weeks. His part-timer now handles customer relationships instead of data entry.

Last Tuesday he sent us a screenshot: "First month I didn't work a single weekend since 2022."

That's not an automation success story. That's a weekend back.
