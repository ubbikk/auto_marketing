The five stages of DIY automation:

1. Excitement: "Zapier looks easy!"
2. YouTube: "Tutorial says 10 minutes"
3. Confusion: "Why isn't it triggering?"
4. Denial: "I just need one more zap"
5. Acceptance: "Maybe I should call someone"

Been there. Built that. Got the broken workflows to prove it.

The problem isn't intelligence. The problem is you're trying to automate processes you've never actually mapped out.

It's like optimizing your morning routine when you haven't admitted you hit snooze 4 times.

The unsexy truth: before you automate anything, you need to write down what you actually do. Not what you think you do. What you actually do.

Then you realize half your "process" is "check email, panic, do the urgent thing."

That's not automatable. That's a management problem wearing a technology costume.

Start with the process. The automation is the easy part.
