I opened Slack on a Saturday.

I know. I know.

But there was a notification and I thought "it's probably nothing" and then it wasn't nothing. It was a client's entire order sync breaking at like 11 PM on a Friday.

Turns out their supplier changed a column header in their CSV. Just one column. "Item_SKU" became "ItemSKU". No underscore.

That's it. That's what broke everything.

I spent two hours fixing something that could've been prevented if anyone had told me "hey, sometimes our supplier randomly renames columns." But nobody thinks to mention that. Because to them it's obvious.

Anyway, the moral of the story is: never open Slack on a Saturday.

Actually the real moral is: your automation is only as good as the assumptions it makes. And it makes a lot of assumptions.

But also don't open Slack on a Saturday.
