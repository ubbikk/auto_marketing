Me at 2 AM: "I'll just manually update these 200 SKUs real quick"

Me at 3:47 AM: staring at row 147, questioning life choices

Me at 4:15 AM: "There has to be a better way"

Me at 9 AM the next day: back at it, having learned nothing

This was 2019. I was running an e-commerce brand. The spreadsheet had become sentient. It knew I feared it.

The breaking point came when I fat-fingered a price update and accidentally listed a $200 item for $20. Sold 47 of them before I noticed.

That day I learned two things:

1. Automation isn't optional at scale. It's survival.
2. The best automation tool is often another human who's good at this stuff.

I ended up hiring help. Cost $3K. Saved my sanity. And probably $10K in mistake-driven losses.

Sometimes the automation isn't a script. It's admitting you shouldn't be the one doing it.

What's your 3 AM spreadsheet story?
