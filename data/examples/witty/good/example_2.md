Client sent me a screenshot of their "automation."

It was a Google Sheet with conditional formatting that turned cells red when inventory got low.

That was the automation. The cells turned red.

Then a human looked at the red cells and manually updated the inventory in a different system. Every day. For like two years.

I'm not making fun of them. I've done stupider. Way stupider. I once spent a month building a Python script that saved me maybe three minutes a week.

The thing about "good enough" solutions is they become invisible. You stop noticing the manual step because it's always been there. It's just part of the job.

Until one day someone asks "wait, why are you doing it that way?" and you realize you have no idea.

The scariest automation problem isn't the complex one. It's the simple one you've normalized.

Anyway. Going to go audit my own spreadsheets now. Probably.
