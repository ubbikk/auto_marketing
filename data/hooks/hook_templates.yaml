hooks:
  contrarian_opening:
    description: "Challenge a common belief, then explain"
    examples:
      - "Everyone says you need to automate everything. That's actually backwards."
      - "I stopped posting daily. My engagement doubled."
      - "The best e-commerce tool isn't Shopify. Here's why."
      - "Automation isn't saving you time. It's hiding problems."
    templates:
      - "{Common wisdom}. Wrong."
      - "Everyone says {advice}. Here's why that's BS."
      - "I stopped {common practice}. Results surprised me."
    anti_patterns:

  specificity_hook:
    description: "Lead with specific details - but use HUMAN number patterns"
    examples:
      - "I spent like $40k on LinkedIn ads last year. Here's what worked."
      - "I looked at maybe a hundred cold emails. Three things kept showing up."

    number_guidance: |
      Use human number patterns, NOT AI-coded specific-but-round numbers:
      - Good: "like 50", "maybe 60", "a few hundred", "around a dozen"
      - Good: "almost 200", "just under a hundred", "a handful"
      - Good (ugly exact when you have real data): "1,247", "143", "$38,400"
      - Good: "two-thirds", "about half", "most of them"
      - BAD: "47", "200", "2,847" - these are AI tells
      - BAD: numbers ending in 0 or 7
      - BAD: fake-precise statistics (73.2%, exactly 47 projects)
