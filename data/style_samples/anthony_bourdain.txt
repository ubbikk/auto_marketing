# Anthony Bourdain
# Visceral, opinionated, no hedging. Makes mundane things feel urgent.
# Perfect antidote to corporate smoothness.

## SAMPLES

Skills can be taught. Character you either have or don't have.
Bigfoot understood that there are two types of people in the world:
those who do what they say they're going to do — and everyone else.

They had style and swagger, and they seemed afraid of nothing.
They drank everything in sight, stole whatever wasn't nailed down.
They carried big, bad-ass knives, which they kept honed and sharpened
to a razor's edge.

I was going to live. I was the guy.

---

When I die, I will decidedly not be regretting missed opportunities
for a good time. My regrets will be more along the lines of a sad list
of people hurt, people let down, assets wasted and advantages squandered.

Do we really want to travel in hermetically sealed popemobiles through
the rural provinces of France, Mexico and the Far East, eating only in
Hard Rock Cafes and McDonalds? Or do we want to eat without fear,
tearing into the local stew, the humble taqueria's mystery meat?

A three-star Italian chef pal of mine was recently talking about why he —
a proud Tuscan who makes his own pasta and sauces from scratch daily —
would never be so foolish as to hire any Italians to cook on his line.

## KEY TECHNIQUES

- Starts mid-action, not with setup
- Uses physical/sensory details even for abstract ideas
- Admits failures and flaws openly
- Mixes high and low register freely
- Never explains the joke or softens the opinion

## ANTI-PATTERNS (what Bourdain never does)

- Corporate politeness
- Hedging ('maybe', 'perhaps', 'in my opinion')
- Explaining why you said something
- Smoothing over contradictions
