## Sample 1: "Obvious to You. Amazing to Others"

Any creator of anything knows this feeling:

You experience someone else's innovative work. It's beautiful, brilliant, breath-taking. You're stunned. Their ideas are unexpected and surprising, but perfect.

You think, "I never would have thought of that. How do they even come up with that? It's genius!"

Afterwards, you think, "My ideas are so obvious. I'll never be as inventive as that."

I get this feeling often. Amazing books, music, movies, or even amazing conversations. I'm in awe at how the creator thinks like that. I'm humbled.

But I continue to do my work. I tell my little tales. I share my point of view. Nothing spectacular. Just my ordinary thoughts.

One day someone emailed me and said, "I never would have thought of that. How did you even come up with that? It's genius!"

Of course I disagreed and explained why it was nothing special.

But afterwards, I realized something surprisingly profound:

Everybody's ideas seem obvious to them.

I'll bet even John Coltrane or Richard Feynman felt that everything they were playing or saying was pretty obvious.

So maybe what's obvious to me is amazing to someone else?

Hit songwriters often admit that their most successful hit song was one they thought was just stupid, even not worth recording.

We're clearly bad judges of our own creations. We should just put them out there and let the world decide.

Are you holding back something that seems too obvious to share?

## Sample 2: "Hell Yeah or No" (paraphrased essence)

When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than "Hell yeah, that would be awesome!" then say no.

We're all busy. We all have too many options. If you're not excited, it's not worth doing.

## Sample 3: "There's No Speed Limit" (key insight)

Kimo taught me that "weights of the notes don't lie." In our first session, he covered a full semester of harmony in three hours.

The standard pace is for chumps. The system is designed to accommodate the average.

If you're more driven than average, you can do way more than anyone expects. And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.
