# Perfect for killing AI 'smoothness'.

## SAMPLES

When Chili first came to Miami Beach twelve years ago they were having
one of their off-and-on cold winters: thirty-four degrees the day he met
Tommy Carlo for lunch at Vesuvio's on South Collins and had his leather
jacket ripped off.

---

The voice on the phone said, 'Hey, Chief? Fuck you. I'll get somebody else.'
This guy was a punk, he had to talk like that. It was okay.

---

There were a lot of terms you had to learn, as opposed to the shylock
business where all you had to know how to say was 'Give me the fuckin money.'

Sunday morning, Ordell took Louis to watch the white-power demonstration
in downtown Palm Beach.

He asked about her flight, hoping, he said, Northwest wasn't still serving
that scrambled egg sandwich with the banana and yogurt. A cold bagel,
for Christ sake.

## ELMORE LEONARD'S RULES OF WRITING

1. Never open a book with weather
2. Never use a verb other than 'said' to carry dialogue
3. Never use an adverb to modify the verb 'said'
4. Keep exclamation points under control (2-3 per 100,000 words)
5. Never use 'suddenly' or 'all hell broke loose'
6. Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip
7. If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it

## KEY TECHNIQUES

- Only 'said' for dialogue tags, no adverbs
- Leave out the parts readers skip
- Never open with weather or setup
- Incomplete sentences are fine
- Let voice carry, not description

## ANTI-PATTERNS (what Leonard never does)

- Thick paragraphs with too many words
- Going into the character's head when reader doesn't care
- 'Upon entering the room' style formality
- Explaining what should be shown
