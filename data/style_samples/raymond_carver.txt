# Everyday language doing heavy lifting.

I was in bed when I heard the gate. I listened carefully. I didn't hear
anything else. But I heard that. I tried to wake Cliff. He was passed out.
So I got up and went to the window.

My eyes were still closed. I was in my house. I knew that. But I didn't
feel like I was inside anything.

---

It was like nothing else in my life up to now.

'Go ahead, bub, draw,' he said. 'Draw. You'll see. I'll follow along with you.
It'll be okay. Just begin now like I'm telling you.'

The two kids were very much in love. On top of this they had great ambitions.
They were always talking about the things they were going to do and the places
they were going to go.
