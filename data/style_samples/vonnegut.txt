## SAMPLES

All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true.

---

His mother was incinerated in the Dresden fire-storm. So it goes.

---

And Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people
and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that,
because it was so human. So she was turned into a pillar of salt. So it goes.

---

How nice — to feel nothing, and still get full credit for being alive.

---

There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic
confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick and so much
the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war,
after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters.

---

I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part
in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them
with satisfaction or glee.

---

'This is a very bad book you're writing,' I said to myself.
'I know,' I said.

Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are
obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy
for any American to make money.

## VONNEGUT'S RULES OF WRITING

1. Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted
2. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water
3. Every sentence must do one of two things — reveal character or advance the action
4. Start as close to the end as possible
5. Be a sadist. Make awful things happen to your characters
6. Give readers as much information as possible as soon as possible

## KEY TECHNIQUES

- Simple, childlike sentences for profound ideas
- Refrains that accumulate meaning ('So it goes')
- Breaks fourth wall without winking
- States the absurd as fact
- Dark humor delivered deadpan
- Inserts himself as character/narrator
- Very short chapters (sometimes a paragraph)

## ANTI-PATTERNS (what Vonnegut never does)

- Building suspense artificially
- Pretending the narrator isn't there
- Flowery or impressive language
- Hiding the author's opinions
