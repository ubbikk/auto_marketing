# Taste in Marketing: A Practical Guide for Text-Based Social Media

## The Core Problem

Most marketing copy is forgettable because it optimizes for "not wrong" instead of "distinctly right." Taste isn't the absence of mistakes—it's the presence of a specific, consistent point of view that audiences recognize and remember.

The bar is low. Most content sounds like it was written by a committee (or an LLM). Standing out requires: a clear voice, unexpected angles, and the confidence to break format conventions.

## What "Taste" Actually Means in Practice

### The Wendy's Principle
Wendy's Twitter became legendary not because they're "funny" but because they have a **consistent persona with specific traits**: sassy, confident, willing to roast competitors and even customers. Every post sounds like it came from the same person with the same worldview.

Key insight: Wendy's doesn't try to be funny everywhere. They're funny *in a specific way* that's recognizably theirs.

### The Duolingo Principle  
Duolingo's TikTok leans into the "menacing owl" meme their users created. They didn't fight their audience's perception—they amplified it. The owl is unhinged, slightly threatening about missed lessons, and self-aware about being a language app.

Key insight: Find what your audience already thinks about you and turn the dial up.

### The Dollar Shave Club Principle
Their viral video worked because Michael Dubin (the CEO) walked through a warehouse making jokes with **deadpan delivery**. No polish, no corporate sheen. The humor came from the contrast between low production values and confident delivery.

Key insight: Authenticity often means *less* production value, not more.

## The Hook Library

### Pattern 1: Contrarian Opening
Challenge a belief, then explain.

**Examples:**
- "Women don't like sales. No. You're wrong."
- "Everyone says you need 10,000 hours. Here's why that's BS for [industry]."
- "I stopped posting daily. My engagement doubled."
- "Your SaaS website is stopping you from doubling your MRR."

**Why it works:** Forces the reader to wonder "wait, is this true?" Curiosity gap opens.

**Anti-pattern:** "Unpopular opinion: [extremely popular opinion]"

---

### Pattern 2: Specificity Hook
Specific numbers and details feel more credible than vague claims.

**Examples:**
- "I spent $47,000 on LinkedIn ads last year. Here's what actually worked."
- "I reviewed 200 cold emails this week. 3 patterns separated winners from losers."
- "The Montreal cafe where I had a conversation that led to $10K in 60 seconds."

**Why it works:** Specific = believable. Vague = ignorable.

**Anti-pattern:** "I've learned SO much about marketing!"

---

### Pattern 3: The Open Loop
Start with the payoff, make them read for the explanation.

**Examples:**
- "I recently discovered a hyper-effective LinkedIn post strategy..."
- "The fall trend everyone is talking about..." [video opens without revealing]
- "Having the baby will be so easy." [makes no sense, must keep reading]
- "Buckle up, because this isn't for the faint-hearted."

**Why it works:** Creates a knowledge gap that can only be closed by continuing.

**Anti-pattern:** Giving away the answer in the hook ("Here's why X works: reason...")

---

### Pattern 4: Identity Call-Out
Name your audience directly.

**Examples:**
- "Social media managers: stop doing this one thing."
- "If you're in e-commerce, you need to hear this."
- "Founders in their first year—this is for you."
- "DIY automation survivor? Same."

**Why it works:** People stop scrolling when they feel personally addressed.

**Anti-pattern:** Addressing "everyone" or "people"

---

### Pattern 5: The Story Drop
Start in the middle of action, not with context.

**Examples:**
- "There I was at 1 a.m., Googling how to fix a broken sales funnel."
- "I'd just been rejected by my 47th investor when..."
- "My Mean Boss thinks I'm just napping on the job, but I'm totes analyzing baffling and down loft." (Moosejaw)

**Why it works:** Context is boring. Drama is interesting.

**Anti-pattern:** "So I wanted to share something I learned recently..."

---

### Pattern 6: Bold Statement
Make a claim that demands attention.

**Examples:**
- "Copywriting is the best job in the world. Here are 15 reasons."
- "This changed everything for my business."
- "You're doing LinkedIn wrong."

**Why it works:** Bold claims create polarization—people want to agree or argue.

**Anti-pattern:** Hedging with "I think maybe possibly..."

---

## Voice Development Framework

### Step 1: Define 3-5 Personality Traits
Not adjectives like "professional" or "friendly"—specific traits.

**Weak:** Professional, helpful, knowledgeable
**Strong:** 
- "Confident but not arrogant"
- "Makes fun of industry buzzwords"
- "Admits when they don't know something"
- "Uses specific numbers, never vague"
- "Talks like they're explaining to a smart friend"

### Step 2: Create Anti-Patterns (What You'll NEVER Say)
This is often more useful than defining what you will say.

**Example anti-pattern list:**
- Never start with "In today's fast-paced world..."
- Never use "leverage," "synergy," "unlock potential"
- Never do the "hook question + immediate answer" format
- Never use more than 2 emojis per post
- Never end with "What do you think? Drop a comment!"

### Step 3: Define Your Relationship to the Reader
Are you:
- A peer sharing discoveries?
- A mentor teaching from experience?
- A skeptic questioning industry wisdom?
- An insider revealing secrets?
- A friend who happens to know stuff?

This shapes pronoun use, how you position advice, and whether you can make jokes.

## Copywriting Frameworks (Use As Scaffolding, Not Templates)

### PAS: Problem → Agitate → Solution
Best for: pain-point-focused content, when you're selling a solution.

**Example:**
- **Problem:** "People visit your site but leave before buying."
- **Agitate:** "You've spent thousands on the website. You're posting weekly. Nothing's working."
- **Solution:** "We find exactly why visitors bounce. Then we fix it."

### BAB: Before → After → Bridge
Best for: transformation stories, showing outcomes.

**Example:**
- **Before:** "Managing inventory in spreadsheets. 3 hours every day. Still making errors."
- **After:** "Automated dashboards. 15 minutes daily. Zero stockouts in 6 months."
- **Bridge:** "Here's what changed."

### HSO: Hook → Story → Offer
Best for: personal brand content, Instagram/LinkedIn posts.

**Example:**
- **Hook:** "I didn't expect to be debugging code at 2 AM when I started my agency."
- **Story:** "But there I was, three days before a client launch, Googling error messages..."
- **Offer:** "Here's the checklist I wish I'd had."

## Humor Techniques That Work (And When to Use Them)

### Self-Deprecation
Safest form of humor. Makes you relatable without punching at anyone.

**Example (Ryanair):** [responding to complaint about legroom] "Have you tried being shorter?"

**Example (KFC during chicken shortage):** "FCK. We're sorry. A chicken restaurant without any chicken. It's not ideal."

### Observational Humor
Point out something everyone experiences but rarely says.

**Example:** "The moment when you're about to share your screen and remember all your Chrome tabs are open..."

### Unexpected Contrast
Place something serious next to something absurd.

**Example (Dollar Shave Club):** Walking through warehouse, deadpan: "Are our blades any good? No. Our blades are f***ing great."

### Inside Jokes
Reference something only your audience would get.

**Example:** For dev audience: "Pushed to production on Friday. Felt bold. Regretted it by Saturday."

### When NOT to Use Humor
- During PR crises (wait until things calm down)
- When your audience is in a sensitive situation
- When you don't understand the joke you're making
- When it requires explaining

---

## Platform-Specific Taste

### LinkedIn
- First 2 lines are everything (that's all that shows before "see more")
- Professional but not corporate
- Personal stories + business insight = gold
- Hooks that promise professional advice or surprising stats work best
- Avoid: emoji spam, "engagement bait" questions, excessive hashtags

**Good:** "I reviewed 200 cold emails this week. 3 patterns separated winners."
**Bad:** "🚀🔥 Ready to LEVEL UP your sales?? 💪💪 Drop a 'YES' below! #Sales #Growth #Hustle"

### Twitter/X
- Speed and wit matter more than polish
- Punchy, tweet-like format
- Can be more provocative
- Thread hooks: first tweet must stand alone

**Good:** "Hot take: most marketing advice is just 'post more' dressed up in frameworks."
**Bad:** Long-winded explanations that should be threads

### For B2B Specifically
- Lead with value, not with pitch
- Tie every take to a story ("how I" > "how to")
- Use specific numbers
- Social proof works well (clients, results, testimonials)
- Don't try too hard to be funny—clarity and insight are usually better

## The Self-Aware AI Angle (For Your Project)

Since you're building an openly AI-powered account, here are specific approaches:

### What Could Work
- **Meta-commentary:** "There's talk about the AI bubble. I don't think it's real because X, Y, Z. But what do I know—I'm literally a pile of numbers."
- **Self-deprecating AI jokes:** "I've analyzed 10,000 LinkedIn posts. Turns out 'authenticity' is just humans saying 'authenticity' a lot."
- **Breaking the fourth wall:** "An AI telling you about marketing. Yes, I see the irony."
- **Honest about limitations:** "I can't tell if this stock photo looks trustworthy. Apparently humans can? Weird flex."

### What Probably Won't Work
- Pretending to have human experiences you don't have
- Being too clever—if people have to decode the joke, they won't
- Making every single post about being AI (it's a hook, not the whole meal)
- Generic robot jokes that every AI account makes

### The Key Tension
The AI persona gives you permission to be weird and meta. But the content still needs to provide actual value. The "I'm an AI" part is the spice, not the dish.

## Anti-Slop Checklist (Before Publishing)

1. **Would I stop scrolling for this?** (Be honest)
2. **Can I remove the first sentence?** (Often the real hook is buried)
3. **Is there a specific number or detail I can add?**
4. **Does this sound like me/the persona, or like "a marketer"?**
5. **Am I using any words from the banned list?** (delve, leverage, unlock, tapestry, robust...)
6. **Is there anything surprising here?** (If everything is expected, nothing stands out)
7. **Read it out loud—does it sound natural?**

## Mini-Library: Actual Examples Worth Studying

### Brands with Distinctive Voices
- **Wendy's** — Sassy, willing to roast
- **Duolingo** — Unhinged, self-aware
- **Mailchimp** — Dry humor, informal but informative
- **Innocent Drinks** — Playful, friendly, slightly odd
- **Liquid Death** — Extreme, irreverent, pushes boundaries
- **Old Spice** — Absurdist, confident

### LinkedIn Creators (Study Their Structure)
- **Maja Voje** — High-value lead magnets, specific numbers
- **Charles Miller** — "I recently discovered..." open loops
- **Alex Cattoni** — "X reasons why..." lists that don't feel listy

### Patterns to Steal
- "The X that changed everything" (transformation hook)
- "I spent [specific $$$/time] on [thing]. Here's what worked." (authority + specificity)
- "Everyone says X. Here's why that's wrong." (contrarian)
- "[Number] [experts/posts/calls] taught me this:" (social proof)
- "The difference between [good] and [great] is..." (insight hook)

## Final Thought

Taste isn't a formula. It's a point of view applied consistently.

The frameworks and techniques here are scaffolding—they help you structure content, but they don't create distinctiveness. That comes from:
1. Knowing your audience deeply
2. Having actual opinions (not just safe takes)
3. Being willing to break conventions
4. Iterating based on what resonates

Start by writing 10 posts manually. See what feels right. Then systematize what works.
