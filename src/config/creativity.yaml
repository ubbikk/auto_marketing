  # Organic structures (replacing formulaic copywriting frameworks)

    - name: "stream_of_consciousness"
      weight: 0.25
      description: "Start with one thought, follow where it leads, land on one insight"
      guidance: |
        No sections. No structure. Just think out loud until you hit something true.
        Start with whatever's on your mind. Follow the thread.
        The reader is watching you think, not receiving a presentation.

    - name: "start_in_the_middle"
      weight: 0.25
      description: "Begin mid-action or mid-thought, never explain the setup"
      guidance: |
        The reader is dropped into the middle. No context. No "let me tell you about..."
        They figure it out from the details. Trust them.
        The story already started before this post.

      description: "Single insight, explored from multiple angles, no tangents"
      guidance: |
        One idea. Say it three different ways. That's the whole post.
        Don't add related ideas. Don't branch out. Just the one thing.
        Depth over breadth.

      description: "Explicitly break PAS/BAB/HSO expectations"
      guidance: |
        Break the expected pattern:
        - Start with the solution, never state the problem
        - All agitation, no resolution
        - Hook with no story
        - Story with no point
        The reader should feel slightly off-balance.
